# cartoon_animation_engine
An engine for cartoon animations resembling 1980s adventure games, SDL2, C++

This program cannot be run without graphics used. However I will not include graphics since they are part of my unreleased project. The code can be inspected in any case.

The engine lets user to construct a cartoon by programming how backgrounds and characters appear on the screen, to where do characters move and what do they say (the functioning of speech bubbles takes a large amount of code). Other features include facial expressions, additional animation features, the sound will be added

This is an ongoing project and newer versions with significant updates have already been made. I will update the code file later (this document is last updated in the 28th March, 2019).

(Since any of my C++ projects does not feature the use of derived classes and class hierarchies, I have practiced these features of C++ by creating some meaningless code elsewhere in order to learn how do they work.)
